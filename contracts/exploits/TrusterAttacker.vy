# @version ^0.3.7

"""
The vulnerability is on line 32 of TrusterLenderPool.sol.
The pool's flash loan function has an extra parameter `target`
which it does a function call to with the data supplied in the 
data parameter. The caller of the flash loan function can therefore
influence the pool to make a function call with any calldata to any address.
If the pool required all flash loan initiators to implement a specified
flash loan receiver interface and called the receiver contract instead
of doing a unprotected funcion call to an arbitrary address with abritrary
calldata, it would protect against this attack.
